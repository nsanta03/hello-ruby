# EXERCISE
# Build a deck of cards. Given the following arrays, use a loop
# (or two... hint, hint) to write out every combination to the
# screen.
ranks = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"]
suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]

#for card in ranks 
#    for type in suits
#        puts "The #{card} of #{type}"    
#    end
#end

# BONUS
# Build the deck so that it doesn't just write the combinations out;
# rather, create a new data structure that holds the cards so they 
# can be shuffled, dealt, etc.
